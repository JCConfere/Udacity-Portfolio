    This website is being submitted for the Udacity/Google Front End Nano Degree
program. I have created two seperate versions of the site. The first version is
this one, which I have pushed to Github, and the secondary version resides on
Codepen.com at the follow url.

https://codepen.io/Jason_C_Confere/full/NMzRLO/

I have not added any outside dependencies, though I will note that the version
that I have released on Codepen has the source for the images located on Imgur.
